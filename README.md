Strategy for Building a Red Team

## Status

Progress: Outline

## Preface

Over the last eight years, I've been a member of or a lead on Red Teams for various large software companies. My experiences have shaped how I view Red Teaming and will likely shape my writing. I'm not interested in declaring the conclusive definition of Red Teaming, nor am I interested in debating the term. I'm only interested in documenting my strategy to build and operate Red Teams. Additionally, this repo is not an operational guide for Red Teaming containing the how-to. That guide would likely need to be updated immediately after being written. I recommend using the publicly available resources in the community to learn the how-to, as these were the same resources I used to become employed as a Red Teamer.

I have the following goals when working as a Red Teamer:

* Discover and remediate issues before all levels of attackers
* Collect data to discover systemic issues (root cause analysis and remediation)
* Collaborate with Blue Teams, SOCs (Security Operation Centers), and Incident Responders so they are better able to disrupt and stop real-world attackers from reaching their goals
* Tell Red Team stories to executives that will inspire them to implement company-wide change
