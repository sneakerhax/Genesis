Strategy for building a Red Team

## Status

Progress: Outline

## Preface

Over the last eight years, I've been on Red Teams for various large software companies. My personal experiences have shaped how I view Red Teaming and will likely shape my writing. I'm not interested in declaring the definitive definition of Red Teaming, nor am I interested in debating the term. I'm solely interested in documenting my strategy to build and operate Red Teams. 

I have the following goals when working as a Red Teamer:

* Discover and remediate issues before all levels of attackers
* Collect data to discover systemic issues (root cause analysis and remediation)
* Collaborate with Blue Teams, SOCs (Security Operation Centers), and Incident Responders so they are better able to disrupt and stop an actual attacker from reaching their goals
* Tell Red Team campaign stories to executives that will inspire them to implement company-wide change
